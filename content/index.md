Hi! My name is Einar W. HÃ¸st. I am a Norwegian software developer and architect.

I write a [blog](/blog/) and do [talks](https://einarwh.github.io/talks) at conferences. I'm interested in domain-driven design, collaborative modelling, API design, and the Web. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

I enjoy Advent of Code. I have made some [visualizations](/aoc/).

I have published my own hype cycles for [agile](/hypecycles/agile/), [artificial intelligence](/hypecycles/ai/) and [enterprise architecture](/hypecycles/ea/).

<!-- I like whimsical hobby projects. Some examples include [Hypercat](https://hypercat.azurewebsites.net/), a concatenative programming language that uses the URL as a stack of values, [Hyperpictures](https://hyperpictures.azurewebsites.net/), a hypermedia-driven tool for composing pictures, and [Hyperwolf](https://hyperwolf.azurewebsites.net/), a hypermedia adaptation of the game "Werewolves and Wanderer". -->

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@einarwh) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/einarwh.bsky.social), even [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/einarwh/).
