# Overproduction

<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>

There’s overproduction. The big selling point for generative AI is productivity. But this quickly leads to overproduction.

As the cost and effort required to produce artifacts approaches zero, we produce more artifacts than we can meaningfully interact with.

Does this mean that the price of artifacts approach zero?

Not really. There is a new problem of filtering and curation.

Is this Maxwell's demon?

Overproduction. Productivity, but volume is not the goal. What are the consequences when volume is infinite and instantaneous?

It’s incredibly easy to generate more output than anyone can interact with in their lifetime.

This applies both to the corporate setting and outside it.

At work, over-zealous enthusiasts can generate a flood of memos, demos, reports that no-one will look at.

Massive increase in output from people who are unable to distinguish good from bad.

It quickly becomes a denial of service attack. You can’t do anything else than cope with the output. The bad part is that the actual valuable content drowns in the flood.

The tripling of output from the worst f\*\*king idiot at work.

Who are likely to ramp up their production the most?
