# The asymmetry of politeness

<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>

One of the hardest things we can do as humans is to see ourselves from the outside. That is, to see ourselves as other see us, or as we see others, which is roughly the same thing. We literally can't do it - our viewpoint is fixed inside our skull after all - so to the extent we try to, it's through thought experiment. And sometimes we don't run very realisitic experiments, and sometimes we forget to run them at all. And always the experiments have systemic problems due to a number of factors, including the self-serving biases.

This is a problem, since many of the ideals of modern society build on a notion of reciprocity and equality. We find it both in the principle of equality before the law and in the golden rule.

Of course there has always been a gap between ideals and reality, but still.
In human affairs, it is a basic assumption that we are somehow equal, that our obligations are mutual.

We find it in the Golden Rule. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule

The social game. A game of many elements. An element of dominance and influence. (Some people - bullies - that that dominance is the entirety of the game.)

In this blog post, I would like to highlight a failure of reciprocity that I call the asymmetry of politeness.

There is a basic assumption in the social contract that we will be reasonably polite in our interactions. The reason is that it is more pleasant for all of us. None us likes to interact with someone who is brash or rude.

Just like trust, politeness is a kind of social glue. And just like trust can be misused by social engineers to achieve goals, so politeness can be misused in the social game. It creates a space that can be both skewed and exploited.

This space opens up the room for bullshit. This is tremendously important today when bullshit is rampant and ubiquitous. It is everywhere. We have literal bullshit machines that make it possible to produce bullshit at an unprecedented scale. We seem to have no qualms in exposing each other to this firehouse of bullshit.

People speak of the age of AI, but it is really the age of bullshit, since our AIs are literal bullshit machines.

To expose someone to unchecked bullshit is extremely offensive.

The principle of reciprocity outlines that we should all be equally polite to one another. But how can we gauge that when we can't see ourselves from the outside? As a result, not all people are equally well calibrated.

And hence we have all encountered people who in various degrees feel free to bullshit their way through life, using cheap rhetoric, engaging in logical fallacies, and making unfounded statements and sweeping generalizions with extreme confidence. They are supported in this by the general expectation of politeness, which demands of us that we suffer such things in silence. In a spectacular case of irony, it is considered rude to point out the reality of such statements or to challenge them, because it will be too embarrassing for someone to be outed as a bullshitter or a bully.

Hence someone might use the principle of politeness as a two-phased weapon in a play for dominance. First by violating it themselves, and then in invoking it if and when they should be challenged by someone pointing out their violation. This can of course be deliberate. There are sociopaths among us. But presumably a more common situation is that people simply don't realize that they have double standards.

Even the notion of psychological safety can be used to protect those who expect politeness to work asymmetrically in their favour, in a particularly bold move. You can't point out that someone is bullshitting, because that might make them feel unsafe. Of course this is a gross abuse of term psychological safety. The real point of psychological safety is to create a space that makes it safe to express your opinion without fear of retribution. It is not to create an environment devoid of critical, even uncomfortable questions, or where no-one ever asks you to provide evidence for your claims. But that doesn't mean it can't be weaponized to that effect. (We already established that audacity and gall...)

cheap rhetoric, logical fallacies, emotional manipulation, etc.
It is of course painful to be called out, to have our assertions challenged...
It creates cognitive dissonance that must be resolved if we are to feel good about ourselves. As always, the easiest way to do that is through self-defense.

### What to do?

It can be difficult to deal with people who have come to expect an asymmetry of politeness. Our patterns of social interactions are deeply ingrained in us. It is hard for people to recognize and accept that their patterns are problematic and that they should work to change them. But there is also little to be gained from complying with their expectations. It is enabling of the abusive behavior and makes you complicit in your own exploitation.

The problem of asymmetries in social relations is of course not limited to politeness. Any aspect of social relations is subject to asymmetries. And for the sociopath and the bully, the asymmetry is the point, since they see social relations as a game of domination. Asymmetry equals domination.
