# The asymmetry of politeness

<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>

One of the hardest things we can do as humans is to see ourselves from the outside. That is, to see ourselves as other see us, or as we see others, which is roughly the same thing. We literally can't do it - our viewpoint is fixed inside our skull after all - so to the extent we try to, it's through thought experiment. And sometimes we don't run very realisitic experiments, sometimes we forget to run them at all, and always the experiments have systemic problems due to a number of factors, including the self-serving biases.

This is a problem, since many of the ideals of modern society build on a notion of reciprocity and equality.
Principle of Isonomia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isonomia#Isonomy

Of course there has always been a gap between ideals and reality, but still.
In human affairs, it is a basic assumption that we are somehow equal, that our obligations are mutual.

We find it in the Golden Rule. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule

A particular case is what I call the asymmetry of politeness. There is a basic assumption in the social contract that we will be reasonably polite in our interactions. We don't like to interact with someone who is rude.

I find bullshit to be rude.

Det er så sinnsykt udifferensiert. Hva er psykologisk trygghet? Det går fort fra trygghet til å si meningen din uten å frykte represalier til beskyttelse mot ubehagelige spørsmål og motforestillinger.

Hva er psykologisk trygghet og hva er at man ønsker seg høflighetsasymmetri?
