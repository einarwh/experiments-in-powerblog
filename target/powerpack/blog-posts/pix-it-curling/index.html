<p>Posted: November 7, 2011</p>
<p>I mentioned <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> in passing in the <a href="/blog-posts/bix-it-pix-it-in-the-browser/">last blog post</a>. In case you haven’t heard of it: it is a super-useful tool you can use to issue HTTP requests from the command line (and a whole slew of other stuff). Just thought I’d jot down a quick note on how to use it to play around with the pix-it HTTP handler.</p>
<p>It’s a breeze, really. So effortless! If you’ve installed cURL and <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> (and added them to your PATH), you can do the whole command-line ninja thing and never take your fingers off the keyboard. <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a> is a bit more -uh- fiddly for in that respect.</p>
<p>Here’s the work flow in it’s entirety. Repeat as necessary.</p>
