<p>Ignorance can hurt you for weeks and months, by forcing you to go through inefficient, mundane and – here’s the main thing – <em>unnecessary</em> hoops to accomplish every-day, common-place things. Like launching Visual Studio with administrative rights.</p>
<p>First off, I use <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> to do pretty much anything (and you should too). Certainly I use it to launch Visual Studio. Every day. Thanks to Launchy, I don’t have to take my spidery fingers off <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/">my lovely keyboard</a> at all. No feeding that gluttenous RSI monster by entering mouse-pointing mode. I just hit ALT+SPACE (to bring up Launchy), type “10”, press ENTER and Visual Studio is on its way. (Launchy has figured out that when I type “10” I really mean Visual Studio 2010.) Total of five keystrokes. Good stuff, not much room for improvement there.</p>

<p>Here’s the catch, though: Sometimes you need to launch Visual Studio with administrative rights. How do you launch an application with administrative rights? Why, you right-click on the short-cut and choose “Run as administrator”, of course.</p>
<p><img src="/images/70587a8b1bf2/launch-as-admin-manual.png" alt="Launching Visual Studio 2010 as admin manually."></p>
<p>Suddenly I’m tossed out of my stream-lined keyboard-centric work flow, and forced to go chasing that pesky mouse. Ouch.</p>
<p>For days and weeks and months I suffered through that, growing ever-so-slightly more annoyed each time. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore and invested the five minutes it took to find a solution. Turns out it’s facepalm-inducingly simple to fix.</p>
<p>See, there’s a little checkbox you can tick off, which says that the shortcut should launch the application as administrator. To find the checkbox, choose <em>Properties</em> for the shortcut and click the <em>Advanced</em> button. You’ll see this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/79998a986980/visual-studio-run-as-admin.png" alt="Ticking off the checkbox for running Visual Studio 2010 as administrator."></p>
<p>So that really fixes the issue at hand right there. However, I wanted to keep the ability to launch Visual Studio as non-administrator as well, since most of the time I don’t need the administrative rights. And you know, when launching as administrator, you have to pause to jump through the UAC hoop. Luckily, you don’t need a mouse to do that, but still.</p>
<p>So I ended up cloning the shortcut, which is located at “C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio 2010”. The clone has the same name as the original, with an “a” (for “admin”) tacked on at the end.</p>

<p>Now I can hit ALT+SPACE, type “10a”, press ENTER, wait a second or two for the UAC to pop up (great UX, thx Microsoft), confirm the launch, and Visual Studio 2010 is on its merry way, running as administrator. Like so:</p>

<p>Good stuff, at last.</p>
